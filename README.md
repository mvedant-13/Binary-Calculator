<b> Features: </b> <br>
<b> 1. Basic Arithmetic Operations </b> <br>
Supports the four fundamental arithmetic operations: Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (*), and Division (/). <br>
<b> 2. Exponentiation </b> <br>
^ operator allows raising a number to the power of another, for performing exponential calculations. <br>
<b> 3. High Precision and Unlimited Number Handling </b> <br>
Supports high-precision arithmetic to handle large integers and floating-point numbers. This feature is crucial for applications requiring exact calculations. <br>
<b> 4. Variables and Assignment </b> <br>
Users can assign values to variables (e.g., x = 5) and use these variables in expressions throughout a session. Variable values are stored and accessible for reuse. <br>
<b> 5. Mathematical Functions </b> <br>
Trigonometric Functions: Includes sine (sin), cosine (cos), and tangent (tan) functions, with results depending on the defined precision (scale). <br>
<b> 6. Built-in Constants </b> <br>
Pi (π): Provides a built-in constant for π, which is useful for trigonometric calculations. <br>
