# Binary-Calculator
bc command of linux <br>
DSA mini project <br>

<b> Features: </b> <br>
<b> 1. Basic Arithmetic Operations </b> <br>
Supports the four fundamental arithmetic operations: Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (*), and Division (/). <br>
Modulus Operation (%) to calculate the remainder. <br>
<b> 2. Exponentiation </b> <br>
^ operator allows raising a number to the power of another, for performing exponential calculations. <br>
<b> 3. Binary Operations </b> <br> 
Bitwise Shift: << (left shift) and >> (right shift) for binary manipulations. <br>
Bitwise XOR: ^ operator performs bitwise XOR (distinct from exponentiation). <br>
<b> 4. High Precision and Unlimited Number Handling </b> <br>
Supports high-precision arithmetic to handle large integers and floating-point numbers. This feature is crucial for applications requiring exact calculations. <br>
<b> 5. Variables and Assignment </b> <br>
Users can assign values to variables (e.g., x = 5) and use these variables in expressions throughout a session. Variable values are stored and accessible for reuse. <br>
<b> 6. Mathematical Functions </b> <br>
Square Root: sqrt() function for calculating square roots. <br>
Trigonometric Functions: Includes sine (sin), cosine (cos), and tangent (tan) functions, with results depending on the defined precision (scale). <br>
<b> 7. Configurable Precision (Scale) </b> <br>
Users can set the precision (or “scale”) for decimal results, allowing control over the number of decimal places for division and trigonometric calculations. Example: scale = 10. <br>
<b> 8. Expression Grouping with Parentheses </b> <br>
Support for grouping expressions with parentheses to manage order of operations accurately. <br>
<b> 9. Built-in Constants </b> <br>
Pi (π): Provides a built-in constant for π, which is useful for trigonometric calculations. <br>
<b> 10. History and Previous Expressions </b> <br>
Tracks past expressions and results, allowing users to reference or reuse them in new calculations. <br>
<b> 11. Error Handling </b> <br>
Handles errors gracefully, including: <br>
Division by zero. <br>
Overflow or underflow errors for large numbers. <br>
Undefined operations (e.g., square root of a negative number if complex numbers are not supported). <br>
<b> 12. User-Defined Functions (Optional) </b> <br>
Future versions may support defining custom functions (e.g., define square(x) { return x * x }) for added flexibility. <br>
